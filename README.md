This project is a simple beginner java project for my COSC 210 Class.
It is an ASCII Shape printer that prints a specific shape input by the user.

The file structure is as follows:
Main
  Shape
    Rectangle
      Square
    Oval*
      Circle*

* = not completed/in-progress

If you have suggestions, please feel free to let me know, I am a beginner.
